# FSharpDeepLearning
Not done.

# Demos
## Charting
This example demonstrates the usage of FSharp.Charting.

## SimpleMatrix
This example has some code for some linear math.

## Simple Xor network
**This example current does not work.**
Very basic deep neural network example.
The neural network will learn to process XOR operator.

## Vulkan
**This example does not work.**
Very basic usage of Vulkan API's compute shader.
The compute shader will calculate some linear math for us.

# Credits
## F# Programming Language
Obviously.

## FsLab
FsLab and its dependencies which came along with FsLab were used for some of these examples.

## Vulkan API
For GPU accelerations, Vulkan API was used. I didn't use CUDA or OpenCL because I wasn't familiar with them.
